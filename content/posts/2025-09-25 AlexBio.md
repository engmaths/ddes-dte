I am currently pursuing a PhD in Data Driven Engineering and Sciences, in the school of Engineering Mathematics and Technology at the University of Bristol. I previously studied MEng Mechanical Engineering at Bristol, graduating with first class honours in 2025. During my undergraduate individual research project I explored the vibrational dynamics of arrows shot from a recurve bow, using finite difference modelling of partial differential equations. I am excited to broaden my skill set by exploring the world of data science and machine learning this year, building on what  I have previously learned. I am interested in how mathematics and numerical modelling can be applied to sports, and hope to continue my research into archery over the coming years.

Outside of the office you will find me competing at local archery competitions, and playing the french horn in university orchestras.
