During the first term, we have found the school to be a welcoming and supportive environment, both academically and administratively. Regular team meetings with Prof. Barton and Prof Wilson have provided a valuable forum for sharing and appreciating different scientific perspectives from experienced researchers. They have also been very supportive in taking care of all the challenges that come with settling into a new environment. We have enjoyed discovering the breadth and interdisciplinary nature of the school’s research areas and meeting many academics from a range of backgrounds. Learning within the DTE has been notably collaborative and bottom-up, allowing us to engage more deeply with topics aligned to our individual interests. 

A strong sense of community within the school quickly made us feel welcome and well-integrated. Working together as a small team in a shared office has fostered close connections and enabled effective exchange of knowledge drawn from our diverse academic backgrounds. A lively social atmosphere, supported by informal events such as coffee and cake gatherings, board game socials, and pub trips, has complemented this collaborative working environment. Guaranteed paid work has been well integrated, and interacting with fellow students has helped us to broaden our skillsets and perspectives. Beyond the school, the PGR Hub and Bristol Doctoral College have provided additional support through regular professional development workshops. Bristol itself has proven to be an enjoyable city: The city being walkable, full of historical and natural sites, alongside an active Student Union offering a wide range of student-led societies, it is an ideal environment to grow as a researcher.
