I worked at UMass Amherst as a Research Fellow at the College of Information and Computer Sciences. There I worked on the Modelling of Quantum Networks under the NSF Center for Quantum Networks. The project is available openly on GitHub as QuantumSavory. Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering at IIIT Tiruchirappalli, India. I am interested in researching Quantum systems for applications in sensing, computing and communication.
