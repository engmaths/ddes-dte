I studied Physics at the Universities of Bayreuth and Göttingen, with a focus on nonlinear and computational methods. As a member of the Complex Systems Theory group at the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization, I contributed to research on epidemiological modelling and opinion formation dynamics.

Following the completion of my Master’s degree, I joined the doctoral program at this institution. My current work aims to strengthen my modelling capabilities, with a focus on improving understanding of global catastrophic epidemic outbreaks and social dynamics.
